# P2P Betting Smart Contract

## ðŸ“Œ Project Title  
**P2P Betting Smart Contract**

## ðŸ“„ Project Description  
The P2P (Peer-to-Peer) Betting Smart Contract is a decentralized Ethereum-based application that enables two individuals to place bets against each other without any intermediary. One user creates a bet with a prediction and locked amount. Another user can accept this bet by staking the same amount. Once the real-world outcome is known, the contract owner (admin) resolves the bet, and the winner receives the full reward.

## ðŸŒŸ Project Vision  
To build a fully decentralized and trustless betting platform that eliminates the need for third-party bookmakers. By leveraging blockchain and smart contracts, this project aims to provide transparent, fair, and secure betting experiences for all participants.

## ðŸš€ Key Features  
- **Decentralized Betting**: Users can create and accept bets without any middleman.  
- **Secure Fund Handling**: Both users deposit equal amounts, locked within the smart contract until resolution.  
- **Admin Outcome Resolution**: Only the contract owner can input the actual result of the event to ensure fair payout.  
- **Instant Payouts**: Winner receives the total pooled amount (2x the bet) instantly once the bet is resolved.  
- **Bet Cancellation**: Creators can cancel unmatched bets and get a refund of their stake.  
- **Event Tracking**: Logs all important actions like bet creation, acceptance, resolution, and cancellation.  
- **Modular Design**: Easy to extend for future upgrades and automation.

## ðŸ”® Future Scope  
- âœ… Integration with **Chainlink Oracles** to automatically fetch real-world outcomes.  
- âœ… Voting-based bet resolution using **DAO mechanisms**.  
- âœ… Allow **multi-party and multi-outcome** bets.  
- âœ… Develop an **intuitive front-end** for user-friendly interaction.  
- âœ… Add **dispute resolution mechanisms** for enhanced trust and fairness.  
- âœ… Deploy on **multiple blockchain networks** for better accessibility and lower fees.
